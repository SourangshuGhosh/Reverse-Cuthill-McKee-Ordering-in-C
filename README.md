# Reverse-Cuthill-McKee-Ordering

**RCM**, a C++ library which computes the Reverse Cuthill McKee (RCM) ordering of the nodes of a graph.

The RCM ordering is frequently used when a matrix is to be generated whose rows and columns are numbered according to the numbering of the nodes. By an appropriate renumbering of the nodes, it is often possible to produce a matrix with a much smaller bandwidth.

The bandwidth of a matrix is computed as the maximum bandwidth of each row of the matrix. The bandwidth of a row of the matrix is essentially the number of matrix entries between the first and last nonzero entries in the row, with the proviso that the diagonal entry is always treated as though it were nonzero.

This library includes a few routines to handle the common case where the connectivity can be described in terms of a triangulation of the nodes, that is, a grouping of the nodes into sets of 3-node or 6-node triangles. The natural description of a triangulation is simply a listing of the nodes that make up each triangle. The library includes routines for determining the adjacency structure associated with a triangulation, and the test problems include examples of how the nodes in a triangulation can be relabeled with the RCM permutation.

Here is a simple example of how reordering can reduce the bandwidth. In our first picture, we have nine nodes:

         5--7--6
           |  | /
        4--8--2
        |  |  |
        9--1--3
        
The corresponding adjacency matrix is:

        * . 1 . . . . 1 1
        . * 1 . . 1 1 1 .
        1 1 * . . . . . .
        . . . * . . . 1 1
        . . . . * . 1 1 .
        . 1 . . . * 1 . .
        . 1 . . 1 1 * . .
        1 1 . 1 1 . . * .
        1 . . 1 . . . . *
        
which has a bandwidth of 7 (lower and upper bandwidths of 3, and 1 for the diagonal.)
